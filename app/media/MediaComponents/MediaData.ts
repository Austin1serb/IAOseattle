    <p class="mb-4">Private security is increasingly being relied upon in Seattle’s downtown area. The Downtown Business Association says that is only intended to be a stopgap measure until Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell’s policing plan crystalizes.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-blue-600">Mayor Harrell announces ‘hotspot’ patrol crime initiative</h3>

    <p class="mb-4">Those patrols arrive as the Downtown Seattle Association (DSA) revealed that it has retained a private security firm to adequately provide security to the downtown area over concern that SPD is short staffed.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “These are dollars we wish we didn’t have to spend,” DSA CEO Jon Scholes told KIRO Newsradio.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “These are dollars we need to spend in order to attempt to preserve safety and security downtown. And we’re not the only one spending money in this regard. You know, there’s small businesses and property owners that are digging into their own pockets to hire off-duty officers if they can, because those shifts are hard to staff with a department that’s depleted. In addition to hiring private security, this is not the way we should be delivering safety and security for our city.”
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">Aleksandr Butowicz, founder of the security company Iron and Oak, contracted by the DSA, tells MyNorthwest that his staff have seen a more robust SPD presence downtown in recent weeks (SPD reports 1,100 officers, with approximately 950 of them deployable, as of early February).</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “We are seeing, in the last last five days, … a tremendous increase in visible police presence. I’m seeing a turn right now that it looks like we have … more police presence,” Butowicz said Tuesday.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “But visibly, it appears that there are more police in the hotspot areas. So that, in my opinion, will actually reduce the need for private security, because most of these concerns really are something where you could solve it directly with a law enforcement officer, if one were available.”
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">Iron and Oak reports that demand for its services and staffing levels are roughly proportional to the decline in uniformed SPD officers. Iron and Oak currently has eight licensed, unarmed security staff on hand.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “There has been more of a demand for our services for calls that I would say are traditionally SPD’s purview,” Butowicz continued. “We’ve gotten a lot of requests for us to respond to, for example, someone trespassing on a property. I’m certain, … speaking more about DSA, … we’ve never got a call like that; we never had people calling us for those services. And now, that’s actually a somewhat frequent call that we receive when people are looking for help.”
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">Looking at the long term, Scholes emphasized that the DSA’s demand for private security is temporary.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “This is a stopgap measure,” Scholes said on Seattle’s Morning News. “What we believe is really Seattle’s most important streets stretch from Seattle Center, to the county courthouse, to the Pike Place Market.”
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “[These] should be our best streets,” he added. “… It’s going to be a litmus test on our ability as a city, as a community to more effectively deal with these issues.”

    <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 mb-4">KOMO News Reporter</p>

    <p class="mb-4">In response to rising crime and other safety issues, a downtown Seattle group has hired private security guards to do the work police officers aren’t able to do amid SPD’s staffing crisis. Those guards will help protect Third Avenue between Stewart and Union streets, according to the Downtown Seattle Association.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Businesses and locals are claiming this extra security is needed along that stretch of downtown that's overrun by the homeless and drugs.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “Tourists, don’t go there. Don’t walk on Third Avenue. It’s not safe,” Victrola Coffee Manager Alexa Baehr stated. She’s urging people to stay away from the same street where she manages the coffee business. “There was a shooting [nearby] a couple weeks ago.”
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “These people are going into the businesses and stealing from them and police hardly ever come around,” Teri Marble from Seattle told KOMO News as she walked near 3rd Ave and Pine St.
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">To help, the DSA is paying unarmed guards from the private security firm Iron and Oak, who have a focus on de-escalation. DSA has been contracting for security patrols for years around the parks they manage, like Westlake Park and Occidental Square. But in an emailed statement, the group says the Iron and Oak patrols are new because they're” filling the gaps in shifts because of SPD staffing issues.”</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Locals have noticed what they're calling a dwindling police presence.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “Things have just gone to Hell between the riots, COVID, the shortage. It’s all just kind of come together to create this vacuum that enables all of this,” Ian Henry of Seattle stated.
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">DSA says it paid about $314,000 in the last fiscal year for private security, and about $250,000 to Seattle Police to work overtime there. The group is expecting to dish out even more this year, already doubling the number of private guards from two to four with patrols seven days a week.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        Baehr says the extra presence from Oak and Iron is needed to help prevent property crime or to keep the homeless from harassing her customers but says more needs to be done to help this area.
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">“I don’t think security is going to deter gun violence or drug use,” Baehr said.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">As KOMO has reported, Seattle police lost a few hundred officers since 2020. It has since filled some of those spots, and the city's budget allows for SPD to hire 125 officers this year.</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 mb-4">Former MyNorthwest Editor</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">As a response to the Seattle Police Department’s (SPD) reported staffing shortage, the Downtown Seattle Association (DSA), via a community levy referred to as a Business Improvement Area (BIA), hired a private security firm, Iron and Oak, to provide public safety support to Third Avenue between Stewart and Union.</p>
    
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-blue-600">Seattle council greenlights community-sponsored levy for Capitol Hill cleanup</h3>
    
        <p class="mb-4">The Metropolitan Improvement District (MID), one of nine BIAs in Seattle, spent $564,000 on private security for the downtown area in the previous fiscal year, between June 2020 and August 2021.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">In total, $314,000 was allocated for private security of Westlake Park and Occidental Square — parks managed by the MID.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “We’ve been contracting SPD officers for emphasis patrols for years, but decreased staffing levels meant SPD couldn’t fill the time slots we needed,” a DSA representative told MyNorthwest. “And we know stretches of Third Avenue need help. Contracting with a private security firm allows us to place a consistent presence along Third, extra sets of eyes that can respond quickly and coordinate with SPD, if public safety needs arise.”
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">An additional $250,000 was spent on SPD “emphasis patrols,” a process by which BIAs are allowed to contract SPD officers through overtime allowances.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “The contract allows us to fund additional SPD overtime shifts, usually through shift extensions,” a DSA statement further clarifies. “The officers are on duty and working extended or additional Seattle Police patrol or bike shifts in downtown. The MID or DSA does not direct the specific work of officers on these shifts, and the officers do not work for the MID or DSA. They continue to report and answer to their chain of command during these shifts. The contract is a funding mechanism as a means of providing additional SPD patrols in downtown, if and when available.”
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">SPD reports 948 active officers as of Jan. 10, citing the need for 1,500-1,600 in total to be considered fully staffed.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Iron and Oak was hired in the fall of 2021 for Westlake and Occidental parks. Beginning last December, they were contracted for additional security services along Third Avenue in downtown Seattle.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">The security firm is separate from other ways in which the MID provides services to the downtown area. Referred to as “safety ambassadors,” they assist in “providing directions to out-of-towners, aiding downtown’s unsheltered population, [and keeping] downtown safe, welcoming and livable,” per the DSA website.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Other community ambassadors provide sanitation services or specialize in homelessness outreach.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Launched in 2013, the latter meets “unsheltered individuals where they are,” and provides case management “to connect them with services, housing, treatment and employment options.” In the previous fiscal year, the DSA reports connecting 34 people with permanent housing, distributing 1,209 hygiene kits, and enrolling 193 people in case management services. The DSA lauds its launch of the now-failed ballot initiative Compassion Seattle in its annual report.</p>
    
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-blue-600">What went wrong for Compassion Seattle’s homeless initiative, and what’s next?</h3>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Established in 1999, the MID is funded through assessments on property owners in the six neighborhoods which it comprises - Belltown, Denny Triangle, Pioneer Square, Retail Core, Waterfront, and West Edge neighborhoods - a 285-square-block area in total.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">The city of Seattle and King County Metro will temporarily shut down the northbound bus stop on Third Avenue between Pike and Pine Streets, beginning April 2. The stop will move about a block down the road to Third and Pike, in front of the Ross store.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">The intention is to quell criminal activity along that corridor in keeping with Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell’s recently announced public safety plan involving targeted police presence along known hotbeds for crime, as a metro spokesperson confirmed with MyNorthwest.</p>
    
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-blue-600">Mayor Harrell announces ‘hot spot’ patrol crime initiative, push to rewrite local gun laws</h3>
    
        <p class="mb-4">The decision follows the placement of a Seattle Police Department mobile precinct in the downtown area, intended to add more visible police presence to an urban stretch where a 15-year-old boy was recently shot and killed. That shooting prompted at least one local business, Piroshky Piroshky, to shutter its doors indefinitely.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">In late February, a similar effort was made to suppress visible drug dealing in Little Saigon at the 12th Avenue and Jackson Street intersection.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “Mayor Harrell is working closely with Chief Diaz and SPD to develop and implement additional strategies addressing crime downtown. Replicating promising early results from 12th and Jackson requires concentrated effort to show noticeable improvement in the short term and a comprehensive approach in the long term — integrating social services, community engagement, economic activation, and more,” a statement from Mayor Harrell reads.
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Aleksandr Butowicz, founder of the security company Iron and Oak, which contracts with the Downtown Business Association, tells MyNorthwest that the mobile precinct “has had a significant impact on the safety of the Pike/Pine corridor.”</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “Once you get outside the coverage of the mobile precinct, the environment becomes far more dangerous. It’s clear that we didn’t actually solve any problems — we just kicked the can down to the next block.”
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">That has left his security team in the position to patrol a wider area of the downtown area.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “With the additional resources now deployed on 3rd Ave, we are starting to move our security teams out to other parts of downtown,” he said. “We are hearing from many businesses and clients that the problems from 3rd Ave have resurfaced on their doorsteps.”
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Shifting the location of the bus stop is intended to calm foot traffic and congestion in the area.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Fed up with surging crime rates that have failed to dissipate, multiple Seattle business owners called upon their elected officials for increased support at a town hall in Ballard Monday night.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Matt Humphrey and his barbershop, Steele Barber and Spa, hosted the meeting as an opportunity to discuss potential solutions.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “It’s sad because the city is really great,” Humphrey told The Jason Rantz Show on KTTH. “I moved here in 2005 and set my life up here and kind of put everything on the line to open a small business 5.5 years ago, and for the last three years, it’s just been brutal.”

            “The crime is not necessarily just those guys, but every time it moves closer, we start to have incidents,” Humphrey said. “It’s just been rough. And we really are concerned about the safety of our staff and our customers.”

        <p class="mb-4">Seattle City Councilmember Sara Nelson was the only one in attendance for the meeting.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">But, as Ballard business owners pine for increased efforts from elected leaders, the city council is undergoing significant changes. Kshama Sawant announced Thursday she is not seeking reelection, making her the fourth of seven council members with expiring terms to announce a departure from the city council. Councilmembers Lisa Herbold (District 1), Alex Pedersen (District 4), and Debora Juarez (District 5) were the other three.</p>

        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “So it was disappointing because I felt like Dan himself had admitted that crime has been tough,” Humphrey continued. “I said, ‘come down here at night and you’ll see,’ and he goes, ‘oh, I know.’ So I think he’s aware.”

            “What we’re expecting universally is the same,” Humphrey stated. “You got to get the police back to the base level. It doesn’t have to turn into a police state, but we got to get cops back on the street because it’s the Wild West. You watch any western, and you see people without law enforcement and how they behave. That’s what’s happening on the streets of Seattle right now.”

            “Whether it’s private security, which I don’t think is necessarily the answer because they don’t always have the training. There are some great outfits out there, though, but something has to change fast,” Humphrey said. “They’ve got to get it in place now, because I spent Thanksgiving in my shop with a $6,000 broken window after an attempted break-in. My landlord was right there along my side, helping me board it up. I mean, this is just not the way civil society is supposed to work.”

            “We’re looking for another 50-100 employees,” D’Amico said. “Not only for events, but also for retail, construction sites. We’re just seeing it across the board. We’re seeing an uptick in the need for security officers and also dealing with the homeless situation.”
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">And because there are not enough security guards out there, D’Amico said his company started a week-long academy.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “So, we can take someone that has no security experience and get them into that entry level at the end of five days of training,” D’Amico said.

        <p class="mb-4">Private security companies often have armed and unarmed officers. Many times, the armed officers are former law enforcement or military.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 text-blue-600">BY DALTON DAY</h2>
    <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 mb-4">Former MyNorthwest Editor</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Private security is increasingly being relied upon in Seattle’s downtown area. The Downtown Business Association says that is only intended to be a stopgap measure until Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell’s policing plan crystalizes.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-blue-600">Mayor Harrell announces ‘hotspot’ patrol crime initiative</h3>

    <p class="mb-4">Those patrols arrive as the Downtown Seattle Association (DSA) revealed that it has retained a private security firm to adequately provide security to the downtown area over concern that SPD is short staffed.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “These are dollars we wish we didn’t have to spend,” DSA CEO Jon Scholes told KIRO Newsradio.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “These are dollars we need to spend in order to attempt to preserve safety and security downtown. And we’re not the only one spending money in this regard. You know, there’s small businesses and property owners that are digging into their own pockets to hire off-duty officers if they can, because those shifts are hard to staff with a department that’s depleted. In addition to hiring private security, this is not the way we should be delivering safety and security for our city.”
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">Aleksandr Butowicz, founder of the security company Iron and Oak, contracted by the DSA, tells MyNorthwest that his staff have seen a more robust SPD presence downtown in recent weeks (SPD reports 1,100 officers, with approximately 950 of them deployable, as of early February).</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “We are seeing, in the last last five days, … a tremendous increase in visible police presence. I’m seeing a turn right now that it looks like we have … more police presence,” Butowicz said Tuesday.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “But visibly, it appears that there are more police in the hotspot areas. So that, in my opinion, will actually reduce the need for private security, because most of these concerns really are something where you could solve it directly with a law enforcement officer, if one were available.”
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">Iron and Oak reports that demand for its services and staffing levels are roughly proportional to the decline in uniformed SPD officers. Iron and Oak currently has eight licensed, unarmed security staff on hand.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “There has been more of a demand for our services for calls that I would say are traditionally SPD’s purview,” Butowicz continued. “We’ve gotten a lot of requests for us to respond to, for example, someone trespassing on a property. I’m certain, … speaking more about DSA, … we’ve never got a call like that; we never had people calling us for those services. And now, that’s actually a somewhat frequent call that we receive when people are looking for help.”
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">Looking at the long term, Scholes emphasized that the DSA’s demand for private security is temporary.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “This is a stopgap measure,” Scholes said on Seattle’s Morning News. “What we believe is really Seattle’s most important streets stretch from Seattle Center, to the county courthouse, to the Pike Place Market.”
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “[These] should be our best streets,” he added. “… It’s going to be a litmus test on our ability as a city, as a community to more effectively deal with these issues.”

              <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 mb-4"> Posted on Friday, September 4, 2020 - 9:17 am</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Seattle has not yet seen large groups of amateur militia coming into the city from around the region to make a right wing stand against protesters. The groups here — and especially on Capitol Hill — are professionals.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">The city’s parks department has now added to the influx, hiring private security to patrol Cal Anderson Park this week following another police raid and camp sweep.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">It doesn’t always go well.</p>
        
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
                “Jaguar Security opted to leave the park on Tuesday evening as the large crowd of protestors was not responding to requests to disperse, and continued to harass the security guards,” a Seattle Parks spokesperson tells CHS.
            </blockquote>
        
            <p class="mb-4">The department says it and Seattle Police “will continue to reassess the situation regularly.”</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">SPD, meanwhile, says it does not coordinate with the private companies but police are contacted about threats occasionally. The official line: SPD does not engage in “operational efforts or coordinating resources” with any private company, a department spokesperson tells CHS.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">Even without SPD’s help, the companies working on Capitol Hill continue to grow. There is a need for a trained security force beyond police, Joseph Spiro of security firm Iconic Global says.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">The recent deadly violence in Kenosha and Portland has come, in part, because poorly trained, armed individuals are putting themselves in dangerous situations, Spiro said.</p>
        
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
                “There’s a big difference between intention and training,” Spiro said.
            </blockquote>
        
            <p class="mb-4">CHS reported here in June on the arrival of Iconic Global on Capitol Hill during CHOP as the private “high threat protection” team became part of the conflicts in the area as it worked to protect what Spiros said was a set of client properties and businesses.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In August, we reported on the increased presence of private security in the neighborhood and a clash between private guards and protesters that required police to rush in.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">There is concern from many including Capitol Hill business owners and property owners CHS has spoken with that there is little difference between the armed militia members seen in cities like Kenosha and the wave of private security entrepreneurs</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">Others have welcomed the groups.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">Craig Swanson of Redside Partners, a firm that manages several Capitol Hill properties including the Odd Fellows Building at 10th and Pine, says he has been so satisfied with Iron and Oak’s presence, he hopes the firm remains “a long term” part of the neighborhood.</p>
        
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
                “To the extent that their services are needed, we’re excited to have them part of the community,” Swanson said.
            </blockquote>
        
            <p class="mb-4">The small company has certainly made itself at home. Office space inside the historic Odd Fellows — also home to businesses including the Century Ballroom and Molly Moon’s Ice Cream — has been turned into the “IAO command center,” owner Aleksandr Butowicz says. And he boasts of the Pan-Tilt-Zoom camera setup he has in place atop the masonry building overlooking Cal Anderson Park. It is there, Butowicz says, to keep an eye on protesters — and the police.</p>
        
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
                “They look up at roof lines just like anyone else,” Butowicz says of SPD, “and the PTZ’s are huge, even four stories up. A civilian might assume they just see regular surveillance cameras, but the cops know what they are, and navigate accordingly.”
            </blockquote>
        
            <p class="mb-4">If that kind of approach to a relationship with the police sounds different, it’s because Butowicz’s company is different. Iron and Oak, Butowicz points out, is nothing like the armed militia in Minnesota and he says the company is also unlike Iconic Global.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">For starters, Iron and Oak is not licensed as a security company in the state of Washington limiting the kinds of actions it can take. Butowicz says Iron and Oak personnel are also armed with pepper spray paintballs not bullets.</p>
        
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
                “We actually used to carry no weapons whatsoever,” Butowicz said in one of several long text messages he has sent to CHS about his work over recent weeks. We’ve edited some of the messages for clarity.
            </blockquote>
        
            <p class="mb-4">But now pepper ball guns have been added to the Iron and Oak mix when standing guard at the Odd Fellows and, increasingly in the field trailing the smaller, faster moving groups of demonstrators active on the Hill in late summer.</p>
        
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
                “We shifted because my staff are usually outnumbered 10-15 to one.”
            </blockquote>
        
            <p class="mb-4">Butowicz says there are other differences. He is there, he says, to support the protest movement. His first presence at CHOP was running the team of “Red Shirt” medics.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">The Odd Fellows headquarters now also makes room for a “Red Shirt Trauma Medics SPC.”</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">Iron and Oaks’ place on the edge of the security industry doesn’t bother Swanson at Redside who says he hired the company on the recommendation of a business tenant. That service put Butowicz inside the world of demonstrators and activists that has collided with day to day life around Capitol Hill. And it has set Iron and Oak in an interesting place, he says.</p>
        
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
                “Understand man, everyone competing against us in the security community hates us,” Butowicz said. “We were so able to undermine SPD with only a red t-shirt, some gauze, and Facebook (no Twitter), that the community bought us an office. Our space in Odd Fellows is crowd funded.”
            </blockquote>
        
            <p class="mb-4">The state is wishy washy at best about what constitutes a “security service.”</p>
        
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
                “The services provided by a private security guard are not detailed in state law. Federal law does describe the services provided by a private security guard,” a spokesperson for the Washington Department of Licensing tells CHS. “Usually, a private security guard license is required when providing contracted security guard services as defined under federal law.”
            </blockquote>
        
            <p class="mb-4">“I don’t care what they call themselves,” Swanson said. “From our perspective, they provide security for the Odd Fellows Building.”</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">Anybody who hires Iconic Global, however, is looking for something more. Armed and easily mistaken for police or military, the team has been a presence during nearly every moment of nearly every protest, demonstration, and Molotov cocktail around the East Precinct.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">Spiro told CHS last month that his teams had also recently switched tactics, beginning to follow protests and marches because it became difficult to track the groups. Demonstrators active on Capitol Hill late this summer have been less and less likely to allow video streamers or media in their midst. The security teams following the crowds can radio other Iconic Global personnel to alert them when a client property might be threatened. The tracking, Spiro acknowledged, brought new tensions to the relationship between the security teams and the marchers. “We’re not instigating with them,” Spiro told us in August. “Our presence does make them feel that way.”</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">The full security operation — Iconic Global is, indeed, licensed to provide security services in the state — is a costly endeavor. Spiro says the licensing, gear, weaponry, and finding qualified, licensed staff is only part of it. Insurance is hugely expensive.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">“If I had to, I’d up my license to armed overnight,” Butowicz of Iron and Oak explained. “That’s only a couple hundred bucks. But my insurance will go from $17,000 per month to almost $80,000 per month. I’d have to close.”</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">The costs, Spiro acknowledged are piling up after months of service on Capitol Hill. The future of his business and his clients is a concern and Spiro says Iconic is “exploring alternative means of protecting our clients in a more long term/financially maintainable fashion.”</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">The end goal for Iconic Global is unclear. The end of the protests would mean the end of this particular stream of revenue for the company. Spiro said that wouldn’t put Iconic Global out of business and there is plenty of other security work for the firm. But, for now, patrol on Capitol Hill is a good deal for his clients.</p>
        
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
                “While maintaining a security presence can be financially straining, having your windows smashed out on a nightly basis can be, too.”
            </blockquote>
        
            <p class="mb-4">--Butowicz’s Red Shirt medics have also been a presence during the months of protest</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">Back inside Cal Anderson, Seattle Parks says it hired Jaguar Security “to provide a presence in the park overnight” and that the company is still intended to be part of securing the area from campers and protest gatherings.</p>
        
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
                “We were working with them on a night-to-night basis, as we reassess daily the security needs for Cal Anderson Park,” the Seattle Parks representative said.
            </blockquote>
        
            <p class="mb-4">Butowicz in the Odd Fellows Building, meanwhile, sees no end game. Iron and Oak is here to stay and ready to take on more work in the neighborhood.</p>
        
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
                “My employees have been walking the park for a week now, in full uniform,” Butowicz writes in a pitch about his company sent to media this week. “We have been integral in the fire intervention efforts in the neighborhood, and are currently the only company that will be able to do this job without endangering either park goers, or our employees.” 
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
                “We can service this in a respectful and nonviolent manner, from an office directly within the community being served,” he writes.

        <p class="mb-4">SEATTLE — It's been a week since Eina Kwon and her baby were shot and killed in a seemingly random shooting. Last Tuesday is a day that keeps Randy Norberg up at night.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            "It's something that will probably stick with me forever," Norberg said.
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Norberg is a security supervisor for Iron and Oak, a private security firm hired by the Downtown Seattle Association. He was just feet away when Eina and her husband were shot in their car at the intersection of 4th Avenue and Lenora Street.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            "Probably about 60 to 70 feet from the intersection and heard a bunch of shots ring out," Norberg said. "I immediately radioed into dispatch and told them shots were fired."
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Norberg took cover for a moment then immediately ran to help. He was the first person to respond to the unthinkable scene.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            "It was really heartbreaking. The first thing I noticed is that she was pregnant. He kept saying that over and over. She's pregnant, She's hurt," Norberg said.
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Eina was eight months pregnant and shot multiple times. Norberg immediately started doing everything he could to save Eina and her baby's life.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            "I grabbed her head and bandaged it with a hemostatic dressing," Norberg said. "I was worried about moving her and right then I heard sirens coming so I held her head and held pressure on her wound until police arrived."
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">King County Prosecutor's said Cordell Goosby ran towards the Kwons' car and fired every bullet in his gun, then ran off. Eina and her baby later died at the hospital.</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 mb-4">by Jackie Kent, KOMO News Reporter</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">SEATTLE - In response to rising crime and other safety issues, a downtown Seattle group has hired private security guards to do the work police officers aren’t able to do amid SPD’s staffing crisis. Those guards will help protect Third Avenue between Stewart and Union streets, according to the Downtown Seattle Association.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Businesses and locals are claiming this extra security is needed along that stretch of downtown that's overrun by the homeless and drugs.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “Tourists, don’t go there. Don’t walk on Third Avenue. It’s not safe,” Victrola Coffee Manager Alexa Baehr stated. She’s urging people to stay away from the same street where she manages the coffee business. “There was a shooting [nearby] a couple weeks ago.”
        </blockquote>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “These people are going into the businesses and stealing from them and police hardly ever come around,” Teri Marble from Seattle told KOMO News as she walked near 3rd Ave and Pine St.
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">To help, the DSA is paying unarmed guards from the private security firm Iron and Oak, who have a focus on de-escalation. DSA has been contracting for security patrols for years around the parks they manage, like Westlake Park and Occidental Square. But in an emailed statement, the group says the Iron and Oak patrols are new because they're” filling the gaps in shifts because of SPD staffing issues.”</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Locals have noticed what they're calling a dwindling police presence.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">DSA says it paid about $314,000 in the last fiscal year for private security, and about $250,000 to Seattle Police to work overtime there. The group is expecting to dish out even more this year, already doubling the number of private guards from two to four with patrols seven days a week.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">“I don’t think security is going to deter gun violence or drug use,” Baehr said.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">As KOMO has reported, Seattle police lost a few hundred officers since 2020. It has since filled some of those spots, and the city's budget allows for SPD to hire 125 officers this year.</p>

     <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 text-blue-600">by Benjamin Cassidy</h2>
    
        <p class="mb-4">IN EARLY FEBRUARY, a comment about Pike Place Market by Seattle City Council president Debora Juarez set off a fresh round of discourse about downtown Seattle. “I don’t go to the Market anymore unless it’s Saturday, broad daylight,” Juarez said at an economic development committee meeting, adding that it’s “a real safety issue.”</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Since then, the hot takes have kept coming. Some are, quite literally, “Seattle is burning.” Others inflame by throwing shade at concerns about crime and addiction. As the pandemic moved office types out of the city’s core, more and more of these narratives only guessed at the reality on the ground, where a few crises converged: homelessness, Covid, and, more insidiously, fentanyl.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Fentanyl-involved overdoses across King County rose to 392 in 2021, up from 171 in 2020 and three in 2015. Caleb Banta-Green, principal research scientist at the Addictions, Drug and Alcohol Institute in the University of Washington School of Medicine, told me that resources have shifted from drug treatment to Covid response, a necessity compelled by the chronic underfunding of public health. “It can only handle one epidemic at a time,” says Banta-Green, “and meanwhile, this other epidemic continues to burn.”</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">In response to fears about downtown, new mayor Bruce Harrell has rolled out “Operation New Day,” which takes a controversial arrests first, services later approach to crime and addiction. It debuted at 12th and Jackson and Third and Pine. “We sort of inherited a mess,” Harrell explained (we tried to warn you about this job, Bruce) during a news conference on March 4.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Yet, less than two weeks later, a Downtown Seattle Association event struck a different tone. When asked to use a word to describe the state of downtown, city attorney Ann Davison said “hopeful”; King County Regional Homelessness Authority CEO Marc Dones said “strong”; and city council member Sara Nelson said “gestating” (really).</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">But a legs-crossed, suited-and-booted event isn’t the best way to take the temperature of all those hot takes about downtown, anyway. Over the past week, I talked to people who live and work at street level about the heart of our city, granting anonymity in certain cases for safety and employment reasons. Their reflections aren’t as grim as the portrayals of a recently fired local TV reporter, but they’re often far from reassuring, both about crime and the city’s response to it.</p>
    
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2 text-blue-600">Aidan, living in an encampment in the Chinatown—International District</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Last week, a sweep off South Weller Street displaced people staying in an encampment. Just down the way on Saturday, Aidan was living in a smaller corridor of tents. “It’s definitely hard to feel stable or wanted,” he says. When the city comes in, “the first thing we think is, Where the fuck are we supposed to go?” Aidan, who’s struggled with heroin, meth, and fentanyl use, knows of services that can help him (he also needs treatment for a bout of cellulitis). But others, he says, either aren’t told or don’t understand what resources are available to them. “There are those people that float.”</p>
    
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2 text-blue-600">A worker at Seattle Chinese Herb and Grocery</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Since the police descended on, in Ann Davison’s words, an “open-air drug market” at 12th and Jackson, the sidewalk outside Seattle Chinese Herb and Grocery has stayed clear, according to a worker there. “The main thing is, we feel safe,” she told me. “We’ve been putting up with that for years.” Smoke used to enter the building. “It’s not good for our health.” A vendor joined the conversation. Before he’d ask her, “Can I deliver to another location?” Now he’s fine stopping by.</p>
    
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2 text-blue-600">Ronaldo Tomas, clerk, Community Grocery and Deli</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Busing into downtown from Federal Way, Ronaldo Tomas doesn’t feel safe. “They always break into the store,” he says, most recently two or three weeks ago. After 10 years working at the Seneca Street business, he’s skeptical that Harrell’s approach will change anything in the neighborhood. “They’re trying to do something different this year, but normally they clean [a] block away, and those people, they just move to another block.” He wants more police, but he’d also like to see the city do a better job “checking which people need a job, which people need a house, or which people need clinics.”</p>
    
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2 text-blue-600">Brooke, living unhoused downtown</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">“It was pretty bad,” Brooke says of Third and Pine. She was squatting in the vicinity over the weekend. Monday through Friday, she usually goes to a church near the West Precinct. “They don’t really bother me,” she says of the city’s authorities, before adding: “Sometimes they ask me to move if I sit in one place for too long.” She’d rather remain outside than stay in a shelter. “I don’t want to sleep with someone’s feet in my face.”</p>
    
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2 text-blue-600">A day porter in Pioneer Square</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">In the middle of the pandemic, a janitor for a building in Pioneer Square watched people walk in front of buses, screaming. People threw stuff at him—a can in an alley where he was working, a chair in Occidental Park. “It was hard for me for a while to want to come down here, especially when everything was shut down. I would just dread getting up in the morning—like, I don’t want to go deal with all that.” But it’s gotten a little easier lately, he told me, setting aside a broom and dustpan. “Now, I see that more people are downtown, so all the bad stuff blends in. I see tourism coming back, stores opening, so I’m optimistic.”</p>
    
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2 text-blue-600">Henry Ferguson, security staffer, Iron and Oak</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Downtown Seattle Association has hired a private security firm, Iron and Oak, to monitor certain areas of the city’s core. Henry Ferguson’s responsibility is the perimeter of Occidental Park, where he keeps watch for 10 hours a day, Friday through Sunday. “I don’t think it’s as dangerous as it’s probably being reported to be,” says Ferguson, who was raised in the Central District. “There were some serious, serious circumstances and dangerous situations that have happened in the last two years… But about crime today, I’m definitely not as fearful as just three weeks ago. Simply because, after the last shooting, and another death, they put officers down there, and they [made] a concerted effort to move people up out of the way. And, at the same time, give ’em help.”</p>
    
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2 text-blue-600">Olga Sagan, owner, Piroshky Piroshky</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">After a fatal shooting right around the corner, Olga Sagan closed her Piroshky Piroshky bakery on Third Avenue in late February. The pandemic slowed foot traffic, she acknowledges, but she’s observed other downtowns coming back quicker; she wants to see a “permanent, consistent solution” to crime in the neighborhood before considering reopening. A mobile precinct on the street is “just a little Band-Aid to appear that, you know, this is safer.” Sagan knows businesses can receive backlash for conflating homelessness with crime, but she feels recent events have made it clear that the latter is what motivates her decisions. “I think we were brave enough to just say, enough is enough. I think a lot of other small business owners are ready to speak right now.”</p>
    
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2 text-blue-600">Ravi Robinson, barista, Cherry Street Coffee House in Pioneer Square</h3>
       <p class="mb-4">At one point during the pandemic, customers at a cafe on First and Cherry had to buzz into the building first due to persistent crime in the area. Ravi Robinson started working at the coffee shop about a year ago. The barista feels that people can be “just extremely dehumanizing when they talk about homelessness” or express “a lack of empathy” for drug addiction and other struggles. “I think people are thrown off by the appearance of a mental health issue because they’re immediately scared…when it’s really uncomfortable, people make all these assumptions.” At the same time, Robinson says that his own sense of safety “might feel a lot different if I was shorter or a woman.”</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2 text-blue-600">Paige Langhorne, barista, Cherry Street Coffee House in Pioneer Square</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">Like Robinson, Paige Langhorne started at the shop in 2021. “It’s working downtown in a city, you know. It’s going to be what it’s going to be.” When it’s light out, she feels fine to walk around. In the dark of morning, her husband accompanies her on her light rail commute. “Since working here, it’s like every other week that someone gets stabbed or shot or something. I know that there was that woman that got pushed down the stairs and really messed her up. There was one morning where my husband got swung at a couple times by a dude. It is what it is. It’s tense times in general, and in spaces like that…it doesn’t really seem like it’s changed at all.”</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2 text-blue-600">Constance Kuhnly, busker</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">If you’ve ever walked down Pine on a Saturday, you’ve heard Constance Kuhnly. Rain or shine, you’ll find the Federal Way resident posted up outside Nordstrom, thermoses of hot tea at the ready, singing for hours on end. Kuhnly has been robbed a few times over the years but has no plans to move now. “What you’re seeing on the news is the extreme.”</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2 text-blue-600">Elkin Guerrero, sandwich maker, Subway</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">Along Third Avenue, Elkin Guerrero offers a slightly different perspective. The sandwich maker has worked at Subway for four years and has recently seen an uptick in drug use and crime around the store. “Since the pandemic’s started, everything’s changed.” Among other incidents, a woman chased Guerrero with a knife around the store, leading to a police call. “I’m so scared. Sometimes I don’t feel like coming here.” Has Harrell’s mobile precinct helped? “I feel a little bit more safe, but as soon as the police leave, they start coming back again.”</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2 text-blue-600">Billie Joanne Isbell, staying at Catholic Community Services’ Bridge Shelter on Third Avenue</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">“I don’t think it’s as bad as it used to be—five, 10 years ago,” Billie Joanne Isbell said of downtown while waiting for groceries on Sunday. “But it could still use some work.” Isbell has bounced around shelters for two decades, she says, and has seen how people experiencing homelessness can be victims of crime in the area. “If you have a ball and they want it, then they’re going to get it.” Still, she thinks addiction is an intractable problem, one that an increased police presence on Third Avenue isn’t going to fix.</p>

     <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 text-blue-600">by Capitol Hill Seattle Staff</h2>
    
        <p class="mb-4">An officer was reported injured and two people were arrested after police say they were forced to intervene in a clash between a small group of protesters and private security on the eastern edge of Cal Anderson Park late Wednesday night.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">A witness tells CHS the officer was splinted at the scene by members of the security patrol. A Seattle Police Department spokesperson says the injury required the officer to be taken to the hospital but Seattle Fire was not dispatched to the scene, according to 911 records.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">The 11th Ave melee was set off after a patrol vehicle from private security firm Iconic Global nearly hit a small group of protesters gathered near a building at 11th and E Olive St, according to video from the scene and the witness account. Police say it was not clear why the security company was responding but that police had to intervene as the scene became heated between the protest group and the heavily armed security team.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            UPDATE: A member of the Iconic Global tells CHS the arrival of an unmarked blue Yukon with SWAT officers — and a different vehicle-protester close call with the Yukon also nearly striking people in the area — also contributed to the tense scene.
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">As the crowd became more agitated over the presence of Iconic Global and the SWAT officers, the security team member said one protester rushed forward with a skateboard and was grabbed by police.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">SPD tells CHS they were in the process of taking that protester into custody during the response when another rushed in and the officer was injured.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">SPD says two women were arrested and booked into King County jail in the incident.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Iconic Global is one of at least three different security firms CHS has documented now working in the Pike/Pine area with heavily armed guards and a fleet of marked and unmarked vehicles that are often mistaken for police or law enforcement officials.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Their presence began this spring at buildings boarded during the COVID-19 restrictions as property management companies sought increased security for empty restaurants and storefronts. The guards were typically uniformed and often armed with a handgun. Some became part of the odd city nighttime scenes of COVID-era Pike/Pine as they kicked back on store furniture and watched videos on their phones in darkened showrooms.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            UPDATE: The owner of another private security firm working out of the Odd Fellows Building at 10th and E Pine tells CHS that SPD’s fast and heavy response Wednesday night came after he reported threats made against his firm and a business in the building they patrol. Aleksandr Butowicz of Iron and Oak tells CHS that threats were made against his company and the business and that he notified SPD. Butowicz said he was also contacted by Homeland Security about the report. Butowicz says his personnel were not part of the security response that set off the 11th Ave conflict. “Iconic has been really aggressive with their overall handling of folks. We focus on de-escalation,” Butowicz said. He reports that Iron and Oak guards aren’t armed with firearms — their weapons fire pepper spray rounds, Butowicz said. “I don’t really believe in firing guns in the most densely populated area of Seattle,” he said.
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">With CHOP, the presence of the security firms has escalated. CHS reported here on the arrival of Iconic Global along 12th Ave where the private “high threat protection” team became part of the heavy security around a collection of businesses and properties on the edge of the protest zone.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">The company’s owner Joseph Spiro said the one-year-old Auburn, Washington company is paid by clients in the area but also is providing some support to businesses and buildings in the area pro bono. The company has been providing security to many of the same collection of businesses and property owners involved in the CHOP lawsuit against the city. Earlier, Spiro declined to identify who pays for the services but some small businesses have reportedly been asked to chip in.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            UPDATE: Spiro tells CHS that he is still in process of looking into the circumstance around what happened on 11th Ave overnight. “Officers were responding to an incident at one of our businesses that we were hired to protect,” Spiro said.
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Spiro tells CHS that his teams have recently switched tactics and have begun following protests and marches because it has become difficult to track the groups as demonstrators currently active on Capitol Hill are less and less likely to allow video streamers or media in their midst. The security teams following the crowds can radio other Iconic Global personnel to alert them when a client property might be threatened. “It’s more efficient than trying to spread across the area,” Spiro said. He said the security personnel will also pick up trash and objects left in the roadway as it follows the crowds.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">The new tracking, Spiro acknowledged, has also brought new tensions to the relationship between the security teams and the marchers. “We’re not instigating with them,” Spiro said. “Our presence does make them feel that way.”</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Like Iron and Oak, Spiro said there is a “misconception” about how heavily armed his personnel are. While those licensed are likely carrying handguns with live rounds, Spiro said his company has spent heavily on “less lethal” weapons including tasers, pepper balls, and batons.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Spiro said tensions with the protesters has risen. “We’ve increasingly become the target,” he said.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Despite the end of the protest zone, the security forces remain. At the Ferrari and Maserati dealership on 12th at Union, armed guards in military style uniforms stand watch as smaller nightly protests continue in the area. The “direct action” protester involve smaller groups as Black Lives Matter demonstrators have moved their efforts to cross other parts of the city. The recent marches have also involved property damage including a night of targeted vandalism that smashed glass and burned goods at a roster of businesses including Amazon, Starbucks, banks, and a Capitol Hill shop owned by the spouse of a Seattle cop.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">We’ve asked businesses involved with the security including Ferrari of Seattle about the ongoing presence but they did not respond. Others have declined to comment.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Butowicz of Iron and Oak said that property manager Redside Partners chose his company because it is not licensed for armed security patrol. “That’s probably the lead of the (sales) pitch,” Butowicz said. “All of them are very familiar with firearms,” Butowicz says of his guards. “They are choosing to work for me unarmed.”</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Some business owners, meanwhile, are caught in the middle as property managers bring in the new security forces. “The first day they were back on duty one of them brought a machine gun and stood in our doorway all night,” one owner tells CHS.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">That owner said they and others end up paying for the security firm and its “conspiracy theory, militia, apocalyptic mentality” as part of the annual common area maintenance clauses part of most commercial leases.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">“The property owners are the ones who hire the security companies,” the business owner said. “They are not hiring this with any kind of equity lens. They are just interested in property.”</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">At least two more security firms have been seen patrolling and providing guard services elsewhere in the neighborhood bringing a heavily armed mix of security professionals into the streets of Pike/Pine every night.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">SEATTLE (KOMO) — The pregnant mother and business owner shot and killed in Seattle's Belltown neighborhood last week is being laid to rest on Friday.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-blue-600">Security Officer's Recollection</h3>

    <p class="mb-4">Eina Kwon, 34, was eight months pregnant when she was shot and died from her injuries; her baby also did not survive. The suspect accused of killing her, Cordell Goosby, is due back in court June 29 to enter a plea.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">KOMO spoke with a security officer, Randy Norberg, who was one of the first on the scene and tried to save Kwon’s life. He patrols downtown Seattle for Iron & Oak Protective Services.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “A lot of the times we’re dealing with overdoses, just two days ago I had to perform CPR with a partner of mine and brought back somebody," Norberg said. "Almost on a daily basis we’re saving lives in that aspect, sometimes people multiple times a day - it takes its toll, but we’re out here to help.”
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">But Norberg was faced with a very different situation on June 13.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">"I walked by probably 30 to 40 seconds before the shooting, the shooting started behind me," Norberg said. "I took cover at first because it was really close, I heard somebody was down on the ground up the street, I ran down there to help."</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Norberg said he ran up to the bullet-ridden white Tesla to see if anyone was injured.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">"She was shot in the side of the head, and she was eight months pregnant," Norberg said. "I came around the passenger side, I applied a couple bandages to her head, I was checking her for other injuries."</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Norberg said he held on to try and stop the bleeding until police arrived, but Kwon and her baby girl did not survive. Kwon’s husband was also injured in the shooting.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Seattle police said Goosby is seen on video suddenly running up to the Kwons’ car and appearing to quickly fire gunshots before running away.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-blue-600">Reflection and Impact</h3>

    <p class="mb-4">As Kwon’s family and friends prepare for her and her child’s funeral services, Norberg said he still thinks about the what if’s. What if he had been there sooner?</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “It’s not easy, I still think about it constantly," he said. "My heart goes out to her family. I wish I could’ve saved her, I  wish I could’ve been there, I’ll never forget her.”

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 text-blue-600">Person sought in connection to shooting that killed 2, injured 1 in Capitol Hill</h2>
    <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 mb-4">by Jackie Kent, KOMO News Reporter</p>
    <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 mb-4">Updated Thu, May 4th 2023 at 2:21 PM</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Seattle police are looking for one person connected to a shooting in the heart of Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood that killed two men and critically injured a third man. The missing person’s involvement in the incident was unclear as of Monday evening.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">The shooting around 10:30 p.m. Saturday at Cal Anderson Park marks the second deadly shooting on Capitol Hill in a month.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “I saw two people hit the ground, get shot completely dead,” said a skateboarder named Kai. “I was over here skateboarding. There was a huge skateboard event happening. I look to my left and I see, ‘Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!’ And we all hit the ground and we all laid down.”
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “It was sad too because there were 40 people at the skate park. Everybody was enjoying themselves,” said the skateboarder who wanted to stay anonymous.
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">The night of the shooting, Seattle Police Department Chief Adrian Diaz acknowledged this tragedy marked the second deadly shooting on Capitol Hill in April. The first was a case of road rage gone wrong.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “We have a lot of people out here trying to enjoy their night and this is what happens. People are too quick to pick up a gun,” Diaz stated.
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">Some people in the area have said they’d like the city to add more park lighting for safety.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “I wish it was just like a little bit more security, just like- not like cops, just like security in general,” added the anonymous skateboarder.
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">A manager with the security company Iron and Oak said they have 55 security officers walking the neighborhood at any given time to protect about 20 businesses. They’re helping with the police investigation by providing surveillance video they say captured the whole incident.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Some people who admit to feeling desensitized to gun violence said they worry these incidents will keep people from visiting Capitol Hill.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “People across the country, I feel like when they hear Capitol Hill [and] Seattle, they think bad stuff already,” Kai added.
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">KOMO News asked the Seattle Police Department if more patrols were planned in the area in light of the recent shootings, and a spokesperson said in a statement, "While we can’t discuss allocation of resources, preventing and responding to violent crime is a priority. The Seattle Police Department places priority on public and community safety - and we take it very seriously."</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 text-blue-600">by Suzanne Phan, KOMO News Reporter</h2>

    <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 mb-4">Updated Sun, April 24th 2022 at 10:32 AM</p>

    <p class="mb-4">The owner of the popular Piroshky Piroshky Bakery in Seattle said she was held up at knifepoint this week on 1st Avenue near Pike and Stewart.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Olga Sagan and many others are worried about ongoing crime in Downtown Seattle, especially in trouble spots like the 3rd Avenue corridor.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">KOMO News talked to people who live and work in the area about the changes they are seeing and asked local leaders what more can be done.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Some of the trouble on a section of 3rd Avenue has cleared out thanks to the Seattle Police Department mobile precinct and extra police officers there. But many people say there's a lot more work needed.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        On Twitter, Olga Sagan, owner of Piroshky Piroshky shared that she was threatened with a knife in Downtown Seattle.
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">Sagan closed down her shop on 3rd Avenue because of all the drugs and crime directly in front of her business.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">On 3rd and Pike at the Melbourne Tower, restaurant and café owner I-Miun Liu has his office headquarters. He has seen all the trouble.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “It’s people literally tripping on drugs, human feces, fights, shoplifting,” said Liu. “I did see a woman there tripping out on drugs, she was convulsing. She was shaking around and people walk by like it’s a regular thing.”
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">Even though a mobile precinct and several police units are now posted in front of his building, Liu is still concerned.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “Safety is number one reason why long term I can’t see us being there,” said Liu. “My main question is 'what’s the long-term plan for sustainability?' The policies that have been enacted over the years have actually led to this. I don’t see any changes in the policy. I just see some clean-up.”
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">Alexander Butowicz is the owner of Iron and Oak Protective Services.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">His staff patrols 3rd Avenue through a program with the Metropolitan Improvement District.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “When we first started, we had anywhere from 8-10 reported incidents per day. That could be anything from medical emergencies to criminal matters. We’re now down to 1-2 incidents every 2-3 days. It doesn’t mean that incidents have been resolved completely, but the area is improving,” said Butowicz. “It’s because of the investments being made both publicly and privately.”
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">People like Olga Sagan worry about crime returning and the mobile precinct going away.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">KOMO News asked Councilman Andrew Lewis and Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell about it.</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
        “Mayor Harrell has returned significant police presence to 3rd Avenue. But what we’ve seen is that is not going to be sufficient. It’s helpful. It’s important that they’re there. But, added support is going to have to come from making physical improvements to 3rd Avenue. It has to come by way of extending the Just Care Programs so police and social workers can make referrals.”
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-4">A spokesman for the Mayor’s office told KOMO News that Mayor Harrell is working to make Downtown Seattle safe through a number of means. He has implemented some critical first steps including a mobile precinct, more officers on site, and temporarily closing the bus stop near 3rd and Pine Street.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">In 2020, the phrase “essential worker” became synonymous with health care, grocery store employees, and first responders. However, local security officers are saying they often feel forgotten, despite their daily interactions with the public.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Last Friday, many of them came together at a march and rally at Westlake Park to demand a stronger union contract that addresses training needs, staffing issues, in addition to sexual harassment, racism, and unsafe conditions experienced in the work place. There are approximately 4,000 security officers represented by SEIU6, according to Executive Secretary Treasurer Katie Garrow.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “You are not demanding any more from your employers than what you are already willing to give everyday at work,” Garrow said. “That is protection, that is safety, that is security. Those are basic rights that every single worker in this MLK County Labor Council deserves.”
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">A number of unionized security officers were on hand to share their experiences while being watched by security officers from Iron and Oak Security. Iron and Oak Security employees were tasked with “close protection” of sanitation workers and Downtown Ambassadors, as well as providing security services at Westlake Park where the rally was being held.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">As supportive union members filled the chairs and repeated chants, security personnel explained why they needed union support at the bargaining table. While many of the issues experienced by security officers were safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Kayla Haughey’s experience required her to take an Uber once or twice a day when public transportation shut down.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">“When I asked for a code to help lessen the costs, I was told it was only for employees, and as a contracted security officer, I was not eligible for it. I was put on the frontline time and time again and told how important I was, although I never felt it.”</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Kevin Bolton Jr., a security guard with two years’ experience, said he was taking additional risk to do his job beyond the ones associated with normal security work.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “We were the ones having to interact with the public, with the risk of bringing COVID back to our families,” Bolton Jr. said.
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">With all the additional responsibilities added to a normal workload, Bolton Jr. feels the companies he provides security for can afford to pay higher wages.</p>

    
        <p class="mb-4">Jasmine Bell, a Starbucks security officer, attends a Mar. 22, 2022 march and rally to support improved working conditions for local security guards.</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Jasmine Bell who works as a security officer at the Starbucks Roastery on Capitol Hill says she has to patrol indoors and out and that everything has changed in the past two years.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “Everyday you have to worry about the homeless, policing, COVID” Bell said.
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Despite the difficulty she experiences trying to communicate with the public while wearing a mask, Bell knows she is ultimately responsible for her own safety while doing her job.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “I love my job, but you have to take yourself into consideration,” she said.
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">It wasn’t just the pandemic that had security officers worried for their safety. Security guard Demetrus Dugar — who is Black — worried about his own safety during the uprisings surrounding the murder of George Floyd by police.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “A lot of us were on the side of the protestors, but when we were walking around, all they saw was a badge,” Dugar said. “Some of that anger went our way a little bit. That was a scary couple of weeks as a security guard and the first time I took my uniform off before walking the two blocks to my car.”
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Veterans of the security profession were on hand to share their stories and explain the changes that came with working in a pandemic. Dugar has spent 16 years in the industry and is on his third bargaining team for a fair security contract.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “Fellow union brothers and sisters have felt overworked and disrespected. We were considered essential but weren’t treated that way. We had to work [on] day one of the pandemic, because our sites don’t guard themselves,” Dugar said.
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Dugar found that over the past two years, he and his colleagues were “left out of hazard pay considerations, we were left off the vaccine list for people who wanted it, and we had to fight to get [personal protective equipment]… thankfully our union fought for everyone who wanted the vaccine.”</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Cameron Lecksiwilai felt that training and staffing for security personnel were both insufficient.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “We need hands-on training from our supervisors, not looking at a screen or book,” Lecksiwilai said. Rita Patterson added that gender and race play a part in her feeling disrespected.
        </blockquote>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “We need a fair chance for career advancement opportunities regardless of our gender or race,” Patterson said.
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">City Council Member Tammy Morales stated her support for those fighting for a stronger contract.</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “Security officers have been out on the streets witnessing first hand the challenges the city is facing. I think it’s time you get treated with the respect you deserve with this work. This contract can help address the changes you need to see, and officers are speaking up because the changes we’re looking for deal with economic justice,” Morales said. “No one should be working 40 hours a week and struggle to put food on the table.”
        </blockquote>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Following Morales, King County Council Member Dave Upthegrove told the crowd that he and others in “positions of power, have your back, so go into negotiations with confidence, because you deserve this.”</p>
    
        <p class="mb-4">Before the rally marched to a non-unionized work place, Westlake Center, across the street, SEIU 6 union President Zenia Javalera told the crowd,</p>
    
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic my-4">
            “Whether they’re demanding an end to racism on the job, an end to sexual harassment, or an end to verbal abuse from supervisors, over 87% of officers are calling for respect. The pandemic and all it’s challenges have only highlighted that every ounce of respect these officers are calling for is earned. They have earned it in their professionalism and their commitment to keeping the peace in an era of high volatility, worsening inequality, and civil unrest.”
